# Accessibility Report

## Audit Summary
- **index.html**: Low contrast for hero text and call-to-action overlays. Adjusted section overlays and card backgrounds for better readability. Carousel and testimonial navigation buttons now have higher contrast backgrounds.
## Notes
Automated axe run attempted but blocked by missing system Chrome dependencies. Manual review via DevTools guided the fixes above.
