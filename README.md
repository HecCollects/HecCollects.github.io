## Development Setup

1. Ensure you have **Node.js 18+** installed.

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This installs Playwright and downloads the necessary browser binaries.

3. Run the test suite:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   Playwright Test will execute the browser-based tests.
